    <section class="ball-info">
        <p>The writing ball was invented by the reverend Rasmus Malling-Hansen, principal
        of the Royal Institute for the Deaf-Mutes in Copenhagen.</p>
        <p>The Hansen ball is a combination of unusual design and ergonomic innovations: its distinctive feature is an
        arrangement of 52 keys on a large brass hemisphere, causing the machine to resemble an oversized pincushion.</p>
        <p>Malling-Hansen tried out different placements of the letters on the keys, to work out the placement that led to the quickest writing
        speed.</p>
        <p>He ended up placing the most frequently used letters to be touched by the fastest writing fingers, and also placed most
        of the vowels to the left and the consonants to the right.</p>
        <p>This, together with the short pistons which goes directly through the ball, makes the writing speed of the writing ball
        very fast.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it does not allow the paper to be seen as it passes through the device.</p>
