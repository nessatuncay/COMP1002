        <h3>About our Founder</h3>
        <p>Malling-Hansen was born in Hunseby, Lolland in 1835. He invented the Hansen Writing Ball in 1865. In 1874 he patented a
        new model jointly in which the cylinder was replaced by a flat carriage on which the paper was fastened. In 1875, the
        original design of the writing ball was replaced with a mechanical frame. With this model, he found a mechanical
        solution for the movement of the paper, dispensing with the battery. While the writing ball was sold in many countries
        in Europe, it was an expensive product and achieved little commercial success. The writing ball was successful at
        different exhibitions, Malling-Hansen and Hall, received the first prize medal at a large industrial exhibition in
        Copenhagen in 1872, and at the world exhibitions in Vienna in 1873, as well as in Paris in 1878. That year
        Malling-Hansen developed a fast speed writing machine to be used for stenography, called the Takygraf. Malling-Hansen
        was also the first person to discover the unique possibilities of blue carbon paper, and developed a copying technique
        he called the Xerografi. It could, in a relatively short time, produce up to one hundred copies of letters and drawings.</p>
